Option 1.1: Extending Two Assignments, 3 Components each.
This is part 1 of Portfolio 2, using lab 6

New Components:
1- HelpCount function in HelpCount.js keeps counts how many times you have hit the help button
2- Timer function in Timer.js 
3- Checkbox for not being a robot


Notes for me:
put npm run web in terminal to open app in brower

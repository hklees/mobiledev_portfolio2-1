Option 1.1: Extending Two Assignments, 3 Components each.
This is part 1 of Portfolio 2, using lab 6

New Components (all use useState):
1- HelpCount function in HelpCount.js keeps counts how many times you have hit the help button
2- Timer function in Timer.js will refresh the page after 1 mintue for security purposes.
3- Greeting function in Greeting.js displays a greeting that the user can change by clicked the button.
